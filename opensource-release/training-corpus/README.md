# 📂 Indic Pretraining Corpus – Representative Sample Release

**Note:** This release contains a **representative subset** of the full **Indic Pretraining Corpus**. The **complete dataset**, including all sources and metadata, will be released **upon paper acceptance**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **Indic Pretraining Corpus** is a **massive, India-centric multilingual text corpus** curated to support **pretraining of large language models (LLMs)** and **multilingual NLP research**.

It is designed to reflect the **linguistic, cultural, and contextual diversity** of India, spanning multiple languages, domains, and styles.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Existing pretraining datasets are often:

* **English-dominant or Western-centric**, missing regional nuances
* Limited in **Indian language coverage** and parallel data
* Scarce in **high-quality web and literary content**

The Indic Pretraining Corpus addresses these gaps by providing:

* **High-quality Indian English text**
* **Indian English ↔ Indian language parallel corpus**
* **Extensive web crawl of Indian content**, including news, blogs, and domain-specific text

This ensures that language models trained on this corpus can understand and generate text that is **culturally relevant, linguistically diverse, and contextually accurate**.
