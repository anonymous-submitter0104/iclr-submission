### Disclaimer

This repository is part of a research effort submitted to ICLR. 

Our objective is to open-source large-scale **Indian multilingual datasets** with the aim of strengthening the open-source AI ecosystem and fostering sovereignty within the Indic AI community. Importantly, all our pipelines are built exclusively on **open-source models available on Hugging Face**. No closed-source LLMs, VLMs, or proprietary AI systems are used at any stage.

We intend to release not only the datasets but also the **data preparation recipes** and the accompanying open-source code. By doing so, we hope to enable the community to reproduce, extend, and innovate upon our methods in a fully transparent and sovereign manner.

The planned open release will include:

* **2T tokens** of high-quality pretraining data
* **300M imageâ€“text pairs** (spanning Indian languages, enabling Indic OCR and VLM development)
* **Indic Persona Hub** (~200M Indian virtual personas)
* **India-centric parallel translated corpora**
* **Indic MMLU** benchmark covering 22 languages
* **Domain-specific Indian taxonomies**
* **High-quality web-crawled English**

All releases will be hosted on Hugging Face after the review process, in compliance with open-source best practices.
