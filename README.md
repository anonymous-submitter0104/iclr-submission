### Disclaimer

This repository is part of a research effort submitted to ICLR. 

Our objective is to open-source large-scale **Indian multilingual datasets** with the aim of strengthening the open-source AI ecosystem and fostering sovereignty within the Indic AI community. Importantly, all our pipelines are built exclusively on **open-source models available on Hugging Face**. No closed-source LLMs, VLMs, or proprietary AI systems are used at any stage.

We intend to release not only the datasets but also the **data preparation recipes** and the accompanying open-source code. By doing so, we hope to enable the community to reproduce, extend, and innovate upon our methods in a fully transparent and sovereign manner.
