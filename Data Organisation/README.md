# Data Organization and Governance

> A governance-first AI data lakehouse for managing 7.5T tokens of Indic multilingual data with complete lineage tracking, metadata cataloging, and policy enforcement at petabyte scale.

---

## Overview

### The Challenge

Building a 7.5T token multilingual Indic dataset requires governance far beyond conventional pipelines. Unlike English corpora, Indic data faces:

- **Fragmentation** across 12+ scripts and diverse sources
- **Noisy digitization** from textbooks, newspapers, and social media
- **Heterogeneous annotation** and inconsistent licensing
- **Long-tail preservation** challenges for low-resource languages
- **Unicode normalization** risks that can collapse distinct scripts

Without rigorous governance, this diversity degrades reproducibility, fairness, and compliance. The challenge is not only scale but **control**: ensuring every transformation remains auditable and low-resource languages are preserved.

### Our Solution

A governance-first AI data lakehouse unifying storage, lineage, metadata, governance, and versioning at petabyte scale, complemented by a **1,400+ domain taxonomy** providing consistent structure and coverage across tasks.
